Simple WPF music player.

This is a very simple music player made using WPF (although there's no MVVM involved). It's by no means a fleshed out player; There's no playlist management, no equalizer, etc. 

## Functionality
+ Plays **mp3**, **wma**, and **wav** files.
+ Drag & Drop files into the player (on the playlist).
+ Shuffle playlist
+ Repteat.
+ Shortcuts:
	+ **[Space]** play or pause current file.
	+ **[Ctrl + O]** open track dialog.
	+ **[mouse wheel]** increase/decrease volume.

## Technical details
- As mentioned earlier, I don't use MVVM.
- All the icons are vectors, and are placed in a resource file. Original SVGs are included.
- WMPLib is used to provide playback/playlist functionality.
